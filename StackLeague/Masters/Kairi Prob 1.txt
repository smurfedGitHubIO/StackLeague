It's time for Kairi's Computer Science class! Their CS Teacher, Ma'am Liselotte, gave them a sussy-looking pseudocode:

global v0, s0, s1

main():
	set_values v0 = 0
	set_values s0, s1 = int(input()), int(input())
	perform fxn1()
	set_values t0 = v0
	perform exit(t0)
	return
fxn1():
	is_equal s1 and 0:
		perform zero()
	is_equal s1 and 1:
		perform one()
	else:
		perform start()
	return
zero():
	set_values v0 = 1
	perform done()
	return
one():
	set_values v0 = s0
	perform done()
	return
start():
	set_values t0 = (s1&1)
	is_equal t0 and 1:
		perform odd()
	set_values s1 = (s1>>1)
	perform fxn1()
	set_values t1 = v0*v0
	perform done(t1)
	return
odd():
	set_values s1 = s1-1
	perform fxn1()
	set_values s1 = s1-1
	return
done():
	set_values v0 = s0
	return
exit(input[0]):
	print input[0]
	return

Kairi seemed to be having a really hard time knowing what the code does so she asks you to help her out on this problem. Given a pair of inputs, return a value that is equivalent to the value returned by running the pseudocode above.
